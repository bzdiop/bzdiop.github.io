excerpt: 'This article looks at the impact of the 2015 European Central Bank unconventional monetary policy (UMP) on income inequality in the Netherlands. To that end, it uses a panel survey from the Dutch central bank to decompose the contributions of selected UMP channels to the change in household income between two periods (11-13 / 14-16). It finds that UMP&apos;s effect through these channels was strongly equalizing. The only two other papers on the topic find similar results for other euro area countries.'
