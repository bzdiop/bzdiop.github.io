I do/did a lot of very random things. And here's a sneak peak: 

#### Conference Hosting
2021 Conference on "machine learning (ML) and economic inequality", with Prof. [Maximilian Kasy](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/).  
2022 ML and Economics day at the Oxford Department of Economics' [Research Jamboree 2022](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/research-jamboree-2022) (with Prof. Kasy).  

#### Photography 
* I was one of ten laureates of the 2018 UNESCO world heritage photography contest
* The same photo was used as a cover of [Wërsëg](https://www.musikbi.com/set/839-werseg), the latest album of the Senegalese Jazz band Jamm  

#### Sports
* I used to swim, competitively -- made it to the Olympics, and got a few African medals (African championships and African games) 
* I also made to the cover of Sport, Les Photos Les Plus Incroyables of Jean-Damien Lesay.
