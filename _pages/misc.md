I do/did a lot of very random things. And here's a sneak peak: 

#### Conference Hosting
2021 -- Conference on "machine learning (ML) and economic inequality", with Prof. [Maximilian Kasy](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/).  
2022 -- ML and Economics day at the Oxford Department of Economics' [Research Jamboree 2022](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/research-jamboree-2022) (with Prof. Kasy).  

#### Photography 
2018 -- I was one of ten laureates of the 2018 UNESCO world heritage photography contest  
2018 -- The same photo was used as a cover of [Wërsëg](https://www.musikbi.com/set/839-werseg), the latest album of the Senegalese Jazz band Jamm  

#### Sports
2007-2011 -- I used to swim, competitively -- made it to the Olympics, and got a few continental medals (African championships and African games)  
I also made the cover of the book _"Sport, Les Photos Les Plus Incroyables"_ by Jean-Damien Lesay.
