  <summary><b>"Antipoverty Policies with Resale Markets: Sorting, Allocative  Efficiency, and Internal Migration" (JMP) -- <p style = "color:red;"> coming soon! </p> </b>
</summary>
  <p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Abstract</b>:  Rural antipoverty programs often focus on increasing agricultural productivity and transfer resources to farmers to help them do so. Yet, many farmers' most productive investment may be in another technology: migration. I explore the impacts of such programs on productivity and on migration. First, I use a difference-in-difference exploiting variations in the roll-out of a Zambian fertilizer voucher program. As expected, the program increases rates of fertilizer adoption and yields. There is an additional two-fold increase in individual outmigration. Meaning that for some farmers, these vouchers lead to divestment from agriculture and to migration. Migration occurring on the year of the program --consistent with farmers monetizing the subsidy on resale markets to fund migration-- accounts for 30% of the variance in migration. Second, I generalize these findings with a structural general equilibrium framework accounting for an externality in adoption. These estimates allow me to compare input subsidies against cash transfers and in-kind programs without resale markets. I find that only input subsidies foster these levels of specialization. When farmers’ types are costly to elicit, resale markets can improve the allocative efficiency of programs. These markets turn any voucher or in-kind program into a cash-transfer to net re-sellers and a large in-kind transfer to net buyers. They thus relax credit constraints for all types of farmers who can specialize.

**Summary**:  We use never-used-before administrative data covering all Ghana’s healthcare staff and facilities. We measure potential gains from reallocating labor across facilities while accounting for administrative constraints. We provide the first comprehensive estimate of a healthcare system production functions. We further explores the allocation of medical labor across vacancies and geographic areas. Finally, we identify complementarities across staff and assignments that contribute to better outcomes. <br>

**Introduction**: A novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to all regions of the world. There is great uncertainty regarding how countries’ characteristics will affect the spread of the epidemic; to date, there are few studies that attempt to predict the spread of the epidemic in African countries. In this paper, we investigate the role of demographic patterns, urbanisation and comorbidities on the possible trajectories of COVID-19 in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal.  
**Methods**: We use an augmented deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to predict the true spread of the disease, under the containment measures taken so far. We disaggregate the infected compartment into asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic and severely symptomatic to match observed clinical development of COVID-19. We also account for age structures, urbanisation and comorbidities (HIV, tuberculosis, anaemia).  
**Results**: In our baseline model, we project that the peak of active cases will occur in July, subject to the effectiveness of policy measures. When accounting for the urbanisation, and factoring in comorbidities, the peak may occur between 2 June and 17 June (Ghana), 22 July and 29 August (Kenya) and, finally, 28 May and 15 June (Senegal). Successful containment policies could lead to lower rates of severe infections. While most cases will be mild, we project in the absence of policies further containing the spread, that between 0.78% and 1.03%, 0.61% and 1.22%, and 0.60% and 0.84% of individuals in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal, respectively, may develop severe symptoms at the time of the peak of the epidemic.  
**Conclusion**: Compared with Europe, Africa’s younger and rural population may modify the severity of the epidemic. The large youth population may lead to more infections but most of these infections will be asymptomatic or mild, and will probably go undetected. The higher prevalence of underlying conditions must be considered.

 <p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Abstract</b>:  Each year, millions of Americans fail to appear in court for low-level offenses, and warrants are then issued for their arrest. In two field studies in New York City, we make critical information salient by redesigning the summons form and providing text message reminders. These interventions reduce failures to appear by 13 to 21% and lead to 30,000 fewer arrest warrants over a 3-year period. In laboratory experiments, we find that whereas criminal justice professionals see failures to appear as relatively unintentional, laypeople believe they are more intentional. These lay beliefs reduce support for policies that make court information salient and increase support for punishment. Our findings suggest that criminal justice policies can be made more effective and humane by anticipating human error in unintentional offenses.<br>
