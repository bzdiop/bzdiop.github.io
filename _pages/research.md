#### JMP: "Migration Consequences of Input Subsidies"
<p style='text-align: justify;'>  <b> Abstract</b>:  Rural antipoverty programs often focus on increasing agricultural productivity by transferring resources to farmers. Yet, many farmers' most productive investment may be in another technology: migration. I explore the impacts of such programs on productivity and on migration. First, I use a difference-in-difference exploiting variations in the roll-out of a Zambian fertilizer input subsidy program (ISP). As expected, the ISP increases rates of fertilizer adoption, yields, and rural labor supply via inmigration. There is an additional two-fold increase in individual outmigration. I show that short-term outmigration (consistent with a relaxed credit constraint) and medium-term oumigration (consistent with structural transformation driven by agricultural productivity gains) account for respectively 30% and 45% of the total variance of outmigration. Household specializing in their comparative advantage can explain these dual results.
Second, I generalize these findings with a structural general equilibrium framework accounting for an externality in adoption. When compared with cash and in-kind transfer policy scenarios, the ISP with resale markets fosters the highest levels of specialization. When farmers’ types are costly to elicit, resale markets can improve the allocative efficiency of programs, turning voucher programs into cash-transfers to resellers and an in-kind transfers to net-buyers.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>  <b>Summary</b>:   We use never-used-before administrative data covering all Ghana’s healthcare staff and facilities. We measure potential gains from reallocating labor across facilities while accounting for administrative constraints. We provide the first comprehensive estimate of a healthcare system production functions. We further explores the allocation of medical labor across vacancies and geographic areas. Finally, we identify complementarities across staff and assignments that contribute to better outcomes.
