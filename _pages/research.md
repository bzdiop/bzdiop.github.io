#### "Migration Consequences of Input Subsidies" [JMP]
<p style='text-align: justify;'>  <b> Abstract</b>:   Input subsidy programs (ISPs) aim to increase agricultural productivity, for many farmers however, outmigration may be preferred and more profitable. Using reduced-form and structural estimations, this paper exploits the variations in the roll-out of the ISP in Zambia to understand the determinants of internal migration for credit constrained farmers. First, I use a difference-in-differences strategy and show that the ISP increases fertilizer adoption but also doubles the rates of individual outmigration. Consistent with farmers being liquidity constrained, I find that 30% of the variance in total outmigration can be explained with farmers monetizing the subsidy in resale markets. Second, I use a structural model to compare ISPs in the presence of resale markets, to a lump sum cash transfer and an in-kind transfer. With resale markets, the ISP is a convex combination of a cash-transfer to resellers and an in-kind transfers to net-buyers. When the model accounts for the externality in adoption, I find that the ISP with resale markets is superior to a cash transfer, and fosters highest levels of specialization and income.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>  <b>Summary</b>:   We use never-used-before administrative data covering all Ghana’s healthcare staff and facilities. We measure potential gains from reallocating labor across facilities while accounting for administrative constraints. We provide the first comprehensive estimate of a healthcare system production functions. We further explores the allocation of medical labor across vacancies and geographic areas. Finally, we identify complementarities across staff and assignments that contribute to better outcomes.
