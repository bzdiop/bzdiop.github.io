## About me

I am a PhD candidate at the [Department of Economics of the University of Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/#/). My research is in applied microeconomics, with a focus on health and migrations. I am interested in understanding the factors --- frictions and preferences --- that influence individuals' decision to relocate within a country.  

I am a teaching assistant for the Quantitative Methods course of the [MSc. in Economics for Development](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/m.sc.-in-economics-for-development#collapse2101516).  
I co-organized a conference on [machine learning and economic inequality](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/ML_inequality_conference/), hosted by Professor [Maximilian Kasy](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/). 

I was previously a research staff at the [University of Chicago Crime Lab and Urban Labs](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/), and at [gui2de](https://gui2de.georgetown.edu/#). <!-- I hold a Master's Degree from the Paris School of Economics, and a _Licence_ from Université Paris Nanterre.-->

I explore how an input subsidy aimed at improving productivity can change migration decisions of credit constrained farmers.  First farmers make a joint decision between using the subsidized fertilizer as an input in their agricultural technology and reselling it to generate income and migrate. Then, if farmers chose to resell their subsidized fertilizers, they act on two margins: either send individual members to outmigrate, or migrate with their household entirely. I model this decision using a discrete choice framework; I find that the decision to either use the improved technology or to migrate depends on a household's comparative advantage in either. Whether a household migrates or sends outmigrants however depends on how binding their credit constraint is. Using data from Zambia, I find that the implications of the model holds and that about 10\% of households respond to the subsidy by sending members to migrate, implying an income effect. I find that households migrate less, implying that the opportunity cost of the subsidy dominates on this margin and households would rather not migrate entirely to keep receiving the subsidy. This paper adds to our still meager understanding how subsidies intending to increase agricultural productivity can change a broader set of decisions, including migration decisions.

<b>Introduction</b> A novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to all regions of the world. There is great uncertainty regarding how countries’ characteristics will affect the spread of the epidemic; to date, there are few studies that attempt to predict the spread of the epidemic in African countries. In this paper, we investigate the role of demographic patterns, urbanisation and comorbidities on the possible trajectories of COVID-19 in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal.<br>
<b>Methods</b> We use an augmented deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to predict the true spread of the disease, under the containment measures taken so far. We disaggregate the infected compartment into asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic and severely symptomatic to match observed clinical development of COVID-19. We also account for age structures, urbanisation and comorbidities (HIV, tuberculosis, anaemia).  <br>
<b>Results</b> In our baseline model, we project that the peak of active cases will occur in July, subject to the effectiveness of policy measures. When accounting for the urbanisation, and factoring in comorbidities, the peak may occur between 2 June and 17 June (Ghana), 22 July and 29 August (Kenya) and, finally, 28 May and 15 June (Senegal). Successful containment policies could lead to lower rates of severe infections. While most cases will be mild, we project in the absence of policies further containing the spread, that between 0.78% and 1.03%, 0.61% and 1.22%, and 0.60% and 0.84% of individuals in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal, respectively, may develop severe symptoms at the time of the peak of the epidemic.  <br>
<b>Conclusion</b> Compared with Europe, Africa’s younger and rural population may modify the severity of the epidemic. The large youth population may lead to more infections but most of these infections will be asymptomatic or mild, and will probably go undetected. The higher prevalence of underlying conditions must be considered.
