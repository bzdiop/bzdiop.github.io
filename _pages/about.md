I am a PhD candidate at the [Department of Economics of the University of Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/#/). 

My research is in applied micro economics, with a focus on health and migrations. I am interested in understanding what are the factors --- frictions, preferences, etc. -- that influence individuals decisions to relocate within a country. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a senior research analyst at the [University of Chicago Crime Lab and Urban Labs](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/crime), and supported health-focused at the Georgetown University Initiative on Innovation, Development and Evaluation ([gui2de](https://gui2de.georgetown.edu/#)).
