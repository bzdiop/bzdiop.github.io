<!-- ## About me -->

I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Economics of the University of Oxford. My research is in applied microeconomics, with a focus on health and migrations. I am interested in understanding the factors --- frictions and preferences --- that influence individuals' decision to relocate within a country.  

<!-- I am the T.A for the Quantitative Methods course of Oxford's MSc. in Economics for Development and co-organized the 2021 conference on "machine learning and economic inequality", hosted by [Maximilian Kasy](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/).  

I will be co-hosting (with Max) on June 20, 2022 the Machine Learning and Economics day at the Department of Economics' [Research Jamboree 2022](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/research-jamboree-2022). Find the [program here](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/ML_Econ_Oxford/Jamboree_2022/).  

Previously, I worked as a research staff at the [University of Chicago Urban Labs](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/), and at [gui2de](https://gui2de.georgetown.edu/#). You can find an excerpt of my [CV here](https://bzdiop.github.io/cv/).-->

  <summary><b>"Input Subsidies in a Second-Best Environment: Allocative Efficiency, and Migration Decisions"</b>
</summary>
  <p>Summary:  I explore the impacts of agricultural input subsidies programs (ISPs) on internal migration. I construct a theoretical framework where ISPs address two common challenges. First, a learning externality leads farmers to use improved inputs only if some neighbors do so. By lowering the costs of adopting inputs, the ISP internalizes this externality. Second, farmers face a binding credit constraint, making the upfront cost of both fertilizer adoption and migration unaffordable. In the presence of resale markets, the subsidized bundle of fertilizer can be traded to either generate liquidity and migrate or purchase more fertilizer and double-down in agriculture. In this setting, resale markets improve the allocative efficiency of the ISP by turning it into a small cash-transfer to net re-sellers and a large in-kind transfer to net buyers. I substantiate the model's predictions using a panel of Zambian smallholders, many of whom benefited from an ISP. I find that the share of households relocating increases by 15pp compared to areas with no subsidy. For the remaining households, an additional 26pp send at least one member out to migrate. <br>

  <p>Summary:  We use never-used-before administrative data covering all Ghana’s healthcare staff and facilities. We measure potential gains from reallocating labor across facilities while accounting for administrative constraints. We provide the first comprehensive estimate of a healthcare system production functions. We further explores the allocation of medical labor across vacancies and geographic areas. Finally, we identify complementarities across staff and assignments that contribute to better outcomes. <br>

  <b>Introduction</b> A novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to all regions of the world. There is great uncertainty regarding how countries’ characteristics will affect the spread of the epidemic; to date, there are few studies that attempt to predict the spread of the epidemic in African countries. In this paper, we investigate the role of demographic patterns, urbanisation and comorbidities on the possible trajectories of COVID-19 in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal.<br>
<b>Methods</b> We use an augmented deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to predict the true spread of the disease, under the containment measures taken so far. We disaggregate the infected compartment into asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic and severely symptomatic to match observed clinical development of COVID-19. We also account for age structures, urbanisation and comorbidities (HIV, tuberculosis, anaemia).  <br>
<b>Results</b> In our baseline model, we project that the peak of active cases will occur in July, subject to the effectiveness of policy measures. When accounting for the urbanisation, and factoring in comorbidities, the peak may occur between 2 June and 17 June (Ghana), 22 July and 29 August (Kenya) and, finally, 28 May and 15 June (Senegal). Successful containment policies could lead to lower rates of severe infections. While most cases will be mild, we project in the absence of policies further containing the spread, that between 0.78% and 1.03%, 0.61% and 1.22%, and 0.60% and 0.84% of individuals in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal, respectively, may develop severe symptoms at the time of the peak of the epidemic.  <br>
<b>Conclusion</b> Compared with Europe, Africa’s younger and rural population may modify the severity of the epidemic. The large youth population may lead to more infections but most of these infections will be asymptomatic or mild, and will probably go undetected. The higher prevalence of underlying conditions must be considered.

  <p>Abstract:  Each year, millions of Americans fail to appear in court for low-level offenses, and warrants are then issued for their arrest. In two field studies in New York City, we make critical information salient by redesigning the summons form and providing text message reminders. These interventions reduce failures to appear by 13 to 21% and lead to 30,000 fewer arrest warrants over a 3-year period. In laboratory experiments, we find that whereas criminal justice professionals see failures to appear as relatively unintentional, laypeople believe they are more intentional. These lay beliefs reduce support for policies that make court information salient and increase support for punishment. Our findings suggest that criminal justice policies can be made more effective and humane by anticipating human error in unintentional offenses.<br>
