My work aims to understand migration and location choices of people under constraints, both positive (driven by central policy choices) and normative (from fairness principles). I will join Boston College as an Assistant Professor after two postdocs at the Stanford King Center and at the Yale EGC --- [**[CV](https://bzdiop.github.io/files/AboutMe/Diop_CV.pdf)**].

  <summary>abstract</summary>
<br style="line-height:0px;" /> 
       <small> Rural development programs often emphasize investments in agriculture, but farmers may instead prefer to divest and leave. I explore how input subsidy programs allow adjustments across two margins: agricultural upgrades and out-migration. Using a large-scale Zambian program and a difference-in-differences design, I find that subsidies increased both fertilizer adoption (upgrades, +79%) and out-migration (+12%). Out-migration rose, funded by farmers re-selling subsidized inputs in the short term (+11%) and using income from productivity gains in the medium term (+14%). Estimates from a choice model show that resales efficiently reallocate fertilizer, and that the ISP achieved higher agricultural upgrades than revenue-neutral cash-transfers. </small> <br>
