I am a PhD candidate at the [Department of Economics of the University of Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/) and a PhD scholar at the Institute for fiscal studies ([IFS](https://ifs.org.uk/)).  
I use innovative micro-data and empirical methods founded in economic theory to study the drivers of internal migration choices and the matching of healthcare workers and facilities at the country level. My work aims to understand migration and location choices of people under constraints, both positive (driven by central policy choices) and normative (from fairness principles).  
Prior to starting my PhD, I was a senior data analyst at the [University of Chicago Urban Labs](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/).  
  
 I will be on the 2022-2023 Academic Job Market. [[CV](http://bzdiop.github.io/files/AboutMe/CV.pdf)]

#### "Migration Consequences of Input Subsidies" 
_Coming Soon!_

<p style='text-align: justify;'>  <b> Abstract</b>:  Rural antipoverty programs often focus on increasing agricultural productivity by transferring resources to farmers. Yet, many farmers' most productive investment may be in another technology: migration. This paper examines in two parts how a Zambian input subsidies (ISPs) affect farmers' farming and migration decisions. First, I use a difference-in-difference strategy exploiting the variations in the roll-out the ISP. I show that the ISP increases fertilizer adoption but also doubles the rates of individual outmigration. Furthermore, 30% of the variance in total outmigration is consistent with farmers monetizing the subsidy in resale markets. Second, I use a structural model to compare ISPs in the presence of resale markets, to a lump sum cash transfer and an in-kind transfer. When the model accounts for the externality in adoption, I find that ISP with resale markets is superior to a cash transfer, and fosters highest levels of specialization. With resale markets, the ISP is a convex combination of a cash-transfer to resellers and an in-kind transfers to net-buyers.
