I am a PhD candidate at the [Department of Economics of the University of Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/) and a PhD scholar at the Institute for fiscal studies ([IFS](https://ifs.org.uk/)).  
  
I use innovative micro-data and empirical methods founded in economic theory to study the drivers of internal migration choices and the matching of healthcare workers and facilities at the country level. My work aims to understand migration and location choices of people under constraints, both positive (driven by central policy choices) and normative (from fairness principles). Prior to starting my PhD, I was a senior data analyst at the [University of Chicago Urban Labs](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/).

#### "The Migration Consequences of Input Subsidies" 
_Coming Soon!_

<p style='text-align: justify;'>  <b> Abstract</b>:   Rural anti-poverty interventions often focus on increasing agricultural investment and productivity. Yet, many farmers can invest in another technology: outmigration. I explore how one common class of interventions – input subsidy programs (ISPs) – can affect the adoption of either technology. First, I exploit the roll-out of an expansive Zambian ISP and a difference-in-differences strategy to show that the ISP fosters specialization into technology based on farmers' comparative advantage, increasing both agricultural yields and outmigration. Second, I estimate a structural model incorporating a positive learning externality related to fertilizer adoption to compare the ISP to alternative revenue-neutral policy counterfactuals. I find that an untargeted cash-transfer would increase migration relative to the ISP. When they target only the would-be beneficiaries of the ISP, both a cash-transfer and an ISP without resale markets would reduce migration. All three counterfactual policies reduce fertilizer use, and hinder the process of specialization.</p>
