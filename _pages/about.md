I am a PhD candidate at the [Department of Economics of the University of Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/) and a PhD scholar at the Institute for fiscal studies ([IFS](https://ifs.org.uk/)).  
I use innovative micro-data and empirical methods founded in economic theory to study the drivers of internal migration choices and the matching of healthcare workers and facilities at the country level. My work aims to understand migration and location choices of people under constraints, both positive (driven by central policy choices) and normative (from fairness principles).  
Prior to starting my PhD, I was a senior data analyst at the University of Chicago Urban Labs.

#### "Antipoverty Policies with Resale Markets: Sorting, Allocative  Efficiency, and Internal Migration" 
_Coming Soon!_  
**Abstract**:  Rural antipoverty programs often focus on increasing agricultural productivity and transfer resources to farmers to help them do so. Yet, many farmers' most productive investment may be in another technology: migration. I explore the impacts of such programs on productivity and on migration. I use a difference-in-difference exploiting variations in the roll-out of a Zambian input subsidy program (ISP). As expected, the ISP increases rates of fertilizer adoption, yields, and rural labor supply. There is an additional two-fold increase in individual outmigration. I show that outmigration in the short-term (consistent with a relaxation of credit constraints) accounts for 30% of the variance in outmigration, while in the medium-term (consistent with structural transformation mediated by agricultural productivity gains) does for 45\%. Household specialization in agriculture or in migration can explain these dual results. I generalize these findings with a structural general equilibrium framework accounting for an externality in adoption.  The conterfactual analysis shows that compared to cash and in-kind transfers, ISP foster highest levels of specialization: addressing both the externality and the credit constraints. When farmersâ€™ types are costly to elicit, resale markets can improve the allocative efficiency of programs. These markets turn any voucher or in-kind program into a cash-transfer to net re-sellers and a large in-kind transfer to net buyers.
