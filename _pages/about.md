## About me

I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Economics of the University of Oxford. My research is in applied microeconomics, with a focus on health and migrations. I am interested in understanding the factors --- frictions and preferences --- that influence individuals' decision to relocate within a country.  

I am the T.A for the Quantitative Methods course of Oxford's MSc. in Economics for Development and co-organized the 2021 conference on "machine learning and economic inequality", hosted by [Maximilian Kasy](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/). 

I previously worked as a research staff at the [University of Chicago Urban Labs](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/), and at [gui2de](https://gui2de.georgetown.edu/#). You can find an excerpt of my [CV here](https://bzdiop.github.io/cv/).

I explore how agricultural input subsidies change migration decisions of credit-constrained farmers.  Farming households make a joint-decision between using the subsidy as an input and using resale markets to generate income and migrate. They allocate labor units on the basis of their comparative advantage in agricultural technologies and in migration. Whether farmers migrate with their household or alone depends on how binding their credit constraint is. The implications of the model hold in a panel of Zambian smallholders in 2001-2008 with a large number of households responding to the subsidy by sending members to migrate, or by migrating altogether implying an income effect. This paper adds to our understanding of how subsidies intending to increase agricultural productivity can change a broader set of decisions, including migration decisions and speak to different margins of its migration decision.

<b>Introduction</b> A novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to all regions of the world. There is great uncertainty regarding how countries’ characteristics will affect the spread of the epidemic; to date, there are few studies that attempt to predict the spread of the epidemic in African countries. In this paper, we investigate the role of demographic patterns, urbanisation and comorbidities on the possible trajectories of COVID-19 in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal.<br>
<b>Methods</b> We use an augmented deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to predict the true spread of the disease, under the containment measures taken so far. We disaggregate the infected compartment into asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic and severely symptomatic to match observed clinical development of COVID-19. We also account for age structures, urbanisation and comorbidities (HIV, tuberculosis, anaemia).  <br>
<b>Results</b> In our baseline model, we project that the peak of active cases will occur in July, subject to the effectiveness of policy measures. When accounting for the urbanisation, and factoring in comorbidities, the peak may occur between 2 June and 17 June (Ghana), 22 July and 29 August (Kenya) and, finally, 28 May and 15 June (Senegal). Successful containment policies could lead to lower rates of severe infections. While most cases will be mild, we project in the absence of policies further containing the spread, that between 0.78% and 1.03%, 0.61% and 1.22%, and 0.60% and 0.84% of individuals in Ghana, Kenya and Senegal, respectively, may develop severe symptoms at the time of the peak of the epidemic.  <br>
<b>Conclusion</b> Compared with Europe, Africa’s younger and rural population may modify the severity of the epidemic. The large youth population may lead to more infections but most of these infections will be asymptomatic or mild, and will probably go undetected. The higher prevalence of underlying conditions must be considered.
