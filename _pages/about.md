My work aims to understand migration and location choices of people under constraints, both positive (driven by central policy choices) and normative (from fairness principles). I will join Boston College as an Assistant Professor after two postdocs at the Stanford King Center and at the Yale EGC --- [**[CV](https://bzdiop.github.io/files/AboutMe/Diop_CV.pdf)**].

<br style="line-height:0px;" /> 
       <small> Rural development programs often focus on increasing agricultural investment, but farmers can also benefit from investing in outmigration. I explore how input subsidies (ISPs) allow farmers to adjust their choices across both agricultural investments and outmigration. First, I use the staggered rollout of a large-scale Zambian ISP to estimate a difference-in-differences. I find that the ISP resulted in significant increases in both rates of fertilizer use (upgrades, +79%) and outmigration (+12%). Outmigration increases because farmers are funding expensive migration in two ways: (i) by selling the ISP vouchers in resale markets in the short run (+11%) and (ii) through the income effect of their increased in-farm productivity in the medium run (+14%). Second, I estimate a choice model and find that resale markets are key to efficiently re-allocate fertilizer among farmers within villages. Furthermore, the current program has three times higher upgrade rates than a revenue-neutral cash transfer program, but outmigration rates are similar. Hence, the ISP incorporating resale markets can be a better suited policy to achieve the dual objectives of enhanced food production and poverty alleviation. </small> <br>
