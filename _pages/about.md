My work aims to understand migration and location choices of people under constraints, both positive (driven by central policy choices) and normative (from fairness principles). I will join Boston College as an Assistant Professor after two postdocs at the Stanford King Center and at the Yale EGC --- [**[CV](https://bzdiop.github.io/files/AboutMe/Diop_CV.pdf)**].

Rural development programs often focus on increasing agricultural investment. Yet, many farmers can benefit from investing in a different  technology: outmigration. I explore how one common class of policies \textemdash\ input subsidy programs (ISPs) \textemdash\ allows households to sort based on the relative returns of these two technologies. First, I exploit area-by-year variations in the roll-out of a large-scale Zambian ISP and use a difference-in-differences strategy. I show that the ISP fosters specialization by farmers based on their comparative advantage, resulting in increases in both agricultural yields and outmigration. Second, I estimate a structural model that incorporates a positive learning externality related to fertilizer adoption. With this externality, the ISP offers advantages relative to alternative revenue-neutral policy counterfactuals. Compared to an untargeted cash transfer, I find that an ISP that allows for re-selling of fertilizer would increase migration out of agriculture. A more targeted cash transfer, or an ISP without resale markets, would reduce migration. All three counterfactual policies reduce fertilizer use relative to the ISP and hinder the process of specialization.
